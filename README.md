## AfterLyf

# Objectives
The end-goal of this project is to demonstrate my understanding so far of coding concepts and technologies such as html, css, and javascript. The AfterLyf web application system, therefore, should be able to highlight my background knowledge on the ease of use, and efficacy of the aforementioned technologies. 

# Learning Goals
1. Test my understanding of basic web application technologies.
2. Check my understanding of using APIs and Communicating with the server.
3. Web application interactivity and application.
4. Building a Single Page Application.

# Introduction
Web application programmes are commonly stored on remote servers and connected to the user through effective communications with the internet. This project provides for a fascinating and engaging navigational experience contextualizing front-end architecture, enabling users to interact with the application and encounter some form of interactivity. the most significant aspect of this project is in gaining familiarity with server-side programming, and its applications. 

# Technologies
HTML
JavaScript
CSS
SCSS

# Recommended Workflow
1. Creating a local and remote repository for my project and establishing a connection.
2. Adding the prerequisite files and folders on my local coding environment. They include <index.html>, <style.css>, <script.js>, <images>, <font-awesome folder>, and the <README.md file>.
3. Integrating an external API.
4. Manipulation of project MVPs to check for interactivity and functionality.
5. Publishing on GitHub Pages.
